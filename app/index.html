          determine the basic shape of the future <strong>:</strong>
          <abbr title="shorthand, throughout this website, for greenhouse gases"><strong>carbon concentration in the atmosphere</strong></abbr>.
          A safe future can only be secured by
          a formal cap on <em>cumulative human emissions</em> <strong>:</strong>
          a &ldquo;carbon budget,&rdquo; that is best stipulated
          by an <strong>independent scientific panel</strong>.</p>

          <p>Cumulative human emissions are both the
          <em>environmentally </em>and the<em> managerially</em> decisive factor.
          Although it will define the future of
          life in the planet, it has been ignored.
          But capping it only takes a standard institutional
          mechanism, that is perfectly within political grasp.

          that is critical to the continuity of civilization.</p>
          <h2>One problem, one determinant factor, one solution</h2>
          <p>This will come to be when a critical mass of people manifest
          their shared awareness of the historic threat,
          and of the common norm that will dispel it:
          banning suicidal pollution, period.
          This raises a host of legal, economic and political questions.
          As we answer them, the organizational implications of
          an effective and exciting transition will become obvious.</p>

          <p>You can propel the shift: by adding your <a href="https://www.change.org/p/world-leaders-who-signed-the-climate-paris-agreement-and-on-whose-hands-the-future-rests-global-carbon-initiative-planting-the-hinge-of-a-safe-future-at-the-core-of-politics" target="_blank"><span>voice</span></a>;
          relaying the news (<img src="_/img/Facebook.png" alt=""/><img src="_/img/Google+.png" alt=""/><img src="_/img/Wordpress.png" alt=""/> <img src="_/img/Pinterest.png" alt=""/><img src="_/img/Email.png" alt=""/>), and especially by
          spreading the word: by <em>talking</em> to, say, two persons (see below). </p>

          <p>Adoption of a carbon budget is the <em>socially
          most consequential</em> climate policy:  Step 1 of the
          historic reconversion and transition needed <strong>:</strong>
          to turn the catastrophe now programed for our children
          into a full regreening of the world.</p>

          <p>This website shows why.</p>

          <p>A &ldquo;transition&rdquo; is another word for passage to a new system.
          So even officialdom is by now implicitly (if still unwittingly)
          recognizing that we need to &ldquo;<em>change the system, not the climate</em>&rdquo;.
          That this happens progressively is no less revolutionary.
          But a new &ldquo;system&rdquo; can only emerge if a new hinge for social
          organization defines its structure: when a coordinating goal is
          available to clarify how policy, action and culture need to be
          (re)aligned to control the one factor that will preserve a stable climate.</p>

          <p>The new social mantra —a <strong>safe global carbon budget</strong>—
          changes the future because it defines
          the managerially decisive goal: the first feature of the
          &ldquo;<strong>carbon-constrained</strong>, <strong>carbon-equitable</strong> and <strong>carbon-neutral</strong>&rdquo;
          policy framework, that can preside over, and catalyze, the transition
          to a <em>carbon-constrained, carbon-equitable and carbon-neutral world</em>
          in which the full diversity of life can at last flourish.</p>

      <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The December 2015 climate accord  that resulted from COP21
          negotiations in Paris has created the general  impression that we
          are now somehow  &ldquo;on course&rdquo; to avert radical  climate disruption.</p>
          <p>That is a delusion that  threatens the very continuity of civilization.</p>
          <p>For besides and beyond its well-recognized  inadequacies
          (regarded as temporary by what is seen as a &ldquo;framework&rdquo; for
          future greenhouse gas emissions limits), the <strong>Paris  Agreement </strong>
          <strong>in effect enshrines a dramatic but unrecognized threat</strong>
          that is only recently coming into view: not only are
          its &ldquo;Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions&rdquo; to pollution
          way beyond the accord's philosophical and aspirational targets.
          <em>Even if these goals are achieved</em>, they ignore
          the &ldquo;tipping points&rdquo; of natural self-reinforcing feedback
          processes expected to trigger &ldquo;<strong>runaway</strong>"<strong> global warming</strong>,
          which would no less than devastate civilization,
          but have been ignored in most standard scenarios.</p>
          <p>This prospect introduces a new, and so far unreckoned, urgency:
          for avoiding it means keeping emissions within “safe”
          (i.e. non-self-accelerating) <em>cumulative</em> levels
          (which are what determines climate).
          That is the operative word: <em><strong>cumulative</strong></em>.
          And this puts us before a momentous choice: between
          1) rapid and <strong>drastic managed</strong> reductions of carbon emissions,
          2) future <strong>radical dislocation</strong> and repression of social organization,
          3) what can only be concisely described as “<strong>climate apocalypse</strong>.”</p>
          <p>It means that, barring a functional correction of the PA’s pollution
          allowances, political representatives unwittingly signed, on April 22 2016,
          in grand celebration and to general applause,

          precisely the &ldquo;suicide pact&rdquo; of which Ban Ki-moon once <a href="http://ow.ly/VeHP8" id="sup2_2" data-toggle="popover" target="_blank">warned</a> us.</p>
          <p>A major information, PR and political campaign is needed to expose this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>But here's the good news:  averting catastrophe begins with
          a couple of simple <a href="http://carbonbudget.info" target="_blank">amendments</a> that could be included in, say, COP22.
          <strong>With the stroke of a pen, the Paris Suicide Pact can be transformed
          into the embryo of a genuine Climate Security Accord</strong>.</p>

          <p>Of course a legal stipulation will never suffice to meet
          the historic challenge —even if proclaimed in solemn pronouncements.
          But it is not supposed to be a <em>sufficient</em>, only a <em>necessary</em> condition:
          there is no way we can organize to meet a condition of survival
          if we don’t know what it is. “<em>If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it</em>.”
          But the logic also works in reverse.</p>

          <p>Only a cap on global cumulative  emissions —a &ldquo;carbon budget&rdquo;:
          the geophysically and managerially decisive factor—
          will preserve the future by <em>avoiding the  unmanageable</em>.   
          (<em>Managing the unavoidable </em>is another
          —equally indispensable but secondary— priority). </p>
          <p>After a properly long gestation, the political birth of
          a carbon budget follows from awareness of the prevailing delusion,
          and emerges from our day's suicidal confusion,
          to put a simple and clear instrument for a safe future
          on the global political table.  This turns Earth Day 2016 from
          a day of obfuscation into a day of awareness and response :
          a new milestone in the climate's slow-motion irruption into history,
          as the defining issue of the 21st Century
          forces itself into everyday politics and life.</p>

          <p> <strong>This is our awareness campaign and <em>politician-empowering</em> <span>*</span> <a href="http://carbonbudget.info" target="_blank">tool</a></strong>
          for the key goal needed to preserve the future:
          <strong>a <a href="http://carbonbudget.info" target="_blank">safe limit</a> to carbon concentration in the atmosphere</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <p><strong><a href="/citizen-mandate.html">A CITIZEN MANDATE TO EMPOWER RESPONSIBLE GOVERNANCE</a></strong></p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>A <a href="http://onepointfivetosurvive.org/carbon-budget.php" target="_blank"><strong>SAFE CARBON BUDGET</strong></a> CAN BE DETERMINED BY
          AN <strong>INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC PANEL</strong>.</p>

          <p>Only this can ensure that
          a <strong>formal limit to manmade cumulative emissions</strong>
          is informed by the best available knowledge,
          to meet the survival imperative now before us.
          And this standard institutional tool, perfectly within reach,
          needed to secure an unobjectionable survival imperative,
          spells the beginning of the full transition
          to which History now summons Humanity.</p>

          <p>By targeting even minimal political action to <strong>the most consequential</strong>
          “<strong>climate policy</strong>,” climate-aware citizens will make it happen:
          as their clamor manifests the awareness needed to enact it,
          until political leadership emerges from our day's
          &ldquo;political polls followership&rdquo; to drive it into the global agenda.</p>
          <p>However long it takes. But the sooner the message attains
          the necessary critical mass, the sooner it will be catalyzed.
          The five years stipulated for revisions of emission commitments
          in the Paris Agreement now program five years of minimal mitigation.
          That’s a precious 35.9 gigatons of CO2 of the carbon budget that can be saved
          for every year that the beginning of serious emission reductions is advanced.</p>
          <p>But we already know one thing:
          history will remember the Paris Agreement as the Paris Suicide Pact.
          Unless it is corrected.</p>
