          This raises a host of legal, economic and political questions.

          spreading the word: by <em>talking</em> to, say, two persons (see below). </p>

          <p>Adoption of a carbon budget is the <em>socially
          most consequential</em> climate policy:  Step 1 of the
          historic reconversion and transition needed <strong>:</strong>
          to turn the catastrophe now programed for our children
          into a full regreening of the world.</p>

          <p>This website shows why.</p>

          <p>A &ldquo;transition&rdquo; is another word for passage to a new system.
          So even officialdom is by now implicitly (if still unwittingly)
          recognizing that we need to &ldquo;<em>change the system, not the climate</em>&rdquo;.
          That this happens progressively is no less revolutionary.
          But a new &ldquo;system&rdquo; can only emerge if a new hinge for social
          organization defines its structure: when a coordinating goal is
          available to clarify how policy, action and culture need to be
          (re)aligned to control the one factor that will preserve a stable climate.</p>

          <p>The new social mantra —a <strong>safe global carbon budget</strong>—
          changes the future because it defines
          the managerially decisive goal: the first feature of the
          &ldquo;<strong>carbon-constrained</strong>, <strong>carbon-equitable</strong> and <strong>carbon-neutral</strong>&rdquo;
          policy framework, that can preside over, and catalyze, the transition
          to a <em>carbon-constrained, carbon-equitable and carbon-neutral world</em>
          in which the full diversity of life can at last flourish.</p>

      <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The December 2015 climate accord  that resulted from COP21
          negotiations in Paris has created the general  impression that we
          are now somehow  &ldquo;on course&rdquo; to avert radical  climate disruption.</p>
          <p>That is a delusion that  threatens the very continuity of civilization.</p>
          <p>For besides and beyond its well-recognized  inadequacies
          (regarded as temporary by what is seen as a &ldquo;framework&rdquo; for
          future greenhouse gas emissions limits), the <strong>Paris  Agreement </strong>
          <strong>in effect enshrines a dramatic but unrecognized threat</strong>
          that is only recently coming into view: not only are
          its &ldquo;Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions&rdquo; to pollution
          way beyond the accord's philosophical and aspirational targets.
          <em>Even if these goals are achieved</em>, they ignore
          the &ldquo;tipping points&rdquo; of natural self-reinforcing feedback
          processes expected to trigger &ldquo;<strong>runaway</strong>"<strong> global warming</strong>,
          which would no less than devastate civilization,
          but have been ignored in most standard scenarios.</p>
          <p>This prospect introduces a new, and so far unreckoned, urgency:
          for avoiding it means keeping emissions within “safe”
          (i.e. non-self-accelerating) <em>cumulative</em> levels
          (which are what determines climate).
          That is the operative word: <em><strong>cumulative</strong></em>.
          And this puts us before a momentous choice: between
          1) rapid and <strong>drastic managed</strong> reductions of carbon emissions,
          2) future <strong>radical dislocation</strong> and repression of social organization,
          3) what can only be concisely described as “<strong>climate apocalypse</strong>.”</p>
          <p>It means that, barring a functional correction of the PA’s pollution
          allowances, political representatives unwittingly signed, on April 22 2016,
          in grand celebration and to general applause,

          precisely the &ldquo;suicide pact&rdquo; of which Ban Ki-moon once <a href="http://ow.ly/VeHP8" id="sup2_2" data-toggle="popover" target="_blank">warned</a> us.</p>
          <p>A major information, PR and political campaign is needed to expose this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>But here's the good news:  averting catastrophe begins with
          a couple of simple <a href="http://carbonbudget.info" target="_blank">amendments</a> that could be included in, say, COP22.
          <strong>With the stroke of a pen, the Paris Suicide Pact can be transformed
          into the embryo of a genuine Climate Security Accord</strong>.</p>

          <p>Of course a legal stipulation will never suffice to meet
          the historic challenge —even if proclaimed in solemn pronouncements.
          But it is not supposed to be a <em>sufficient</em>, only a <em>necessary</em> condition:
          there is no way we can organize to meet a condition of survival
          if we don’t know what it is. “<em>If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it</em>.”
          But the logic also works in reverse.</p>

          <p>Only a cap on global cumulative  emissions —a &ldquo;carbon budget&rdquo;:
          the geophysically and managerially decisive factor—
          will preserve the future by <em>avoiding the  unmanageable</em>.   
          (<em>Managing the unavoidable </em>is another
          —equally indispensable but secondary— priority). </p>
          <p>After a properly long gestation, the political birth of
          a carbon budget follows from awareness of the prevailing delusion,
          and emerges from our day's suicidal confusion,
          to put a simple and clear instrument for a safe future
          on the global political table.  This turns Earth Day 2016 from
          a day of obfuscation into a day of awareness and response :
          a new milestone in the climate's slow-motion irruption into history,
          as the defining issue of the 21st Century
          forces itself into everyday politics and life.</p>

          <p> <strong>This is our awareness campaign and <em>politician-empowering</em> <span>*</span> <a href="http://carbonbudget.info" target="_blank">tool</a></strong>
          for the key goal needed to preserve the future:

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>Politicians are no more &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; today than they have always been.
          The problem is that even when they are aware of the <em>scale of the threat</em>,
          of the <em>speed of action</em> it summons, and concerned with
          <em>protecting society</em>, even the principled ones are impotent
          in the face of a historical challenge of unprecedented scope.</p>

          <p>For the climate threat represents no less than
          “<strong>a crisis of civilization that dares not speak its name</strong>,”
          as François Hollande once whispered.</p>

          <p>Governance, above all, is overwhelmed by 1) the <em>scale</em> of a transition that
          requires rapidly abandoning over 80% of the energy that fuels modern
          civilization, 2) the weight of <em>social inertia</em> due to public unawareness,
          3) the <em>interests vested</em> in the fossil fuels that survival requires abandoning.</p>

          <p><strong>1) AN ENVIRONMENTALLY EFFECTIVE AND POLITICALLY ATTAINABLE GOAL…</strong></p>

          <p>It should be obvious by now that the continuity of civilization presumes
          systemic change. We know that a historic “transition” is required.
          And that any transition presumes a clear understanding of,
          first, “where” we want to go, and then, “how” to get there.</p>

          <p>But this much is also clear:  we need to move <em>rapidly</em> to a radically
          <strong>carbon-constrained, carbon-equitable and carbon-neutral world</strong>,
          and this can be catalyzed less by techno-fixes than by appropriate
          —carbon-constrained, carbon-equitable and carbon-neutral—
          <em>institutional frameworks</em> at both the global and national levels.</p>

          <p>The first goal that the new institutional architecture
          needs to ensure is a <em>carbon-constrained global economy</em>:
          one that climate scientists can confidently expect to
          <strong>dispel undue risk of triggering </strong>“<strong>runaway global warming</strong>.”
          Any policy that achieves this goal must first specify it. </p>

          <p><span><em>By defining our goal more clearly, by making
          it seem more manageable and less remote,
          we can help all people to see it, to draw hope from it,
          and to move irresistibly towards it</em></span>. John F Kennedy</p>

          <p>We can give responsible but disoriented or handcuffed political
          representatives the popular mandate they need to overcome social
          and institutional inertia, and interests vested in the carbon economy,
          to beat their adversaries and begin securing a livable future:
          a “<strong>safe global carbon budget</strong>”.</p>

          <p><strong>2) …AND A SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY CONSEQUENTIAL GOAL</strong></p>

          <p><em><strong>The most effective political action</strong></em> is that
          which aims at, and furthers, <em><strong>the most consequential</strong></em> goals.</p>

          <p>Many social causes and proposals now pursuing partial corrections of the
          present system can be shown to <em><strong>follow inexorably from its adoption</strong></em>:</p>
          <p>First and foremost, preservation of a livable future, <strong>protection of biodiversity</strong> and of <strong>the lives of the poor</strong>, who will be most impacted
          by global warming even though they are least responsible for it;
          by ensuring that civilization-threatening <strong>fossil fuels stay in the ground</strong>;
          the resulting <strong>divestment from carbon-dependant infrastructure</strong>,
          such as <strong>oil pipelines</strong> or environmentally and socially poisoning <strong>fracking</strong>; but also
          other investments in energy-intensive methods (lest they become stranded assets)
          thanks to a &ldquo;<strong>price on carbon</strong>&rdquo; that is <strong><em>high enough to reduce emissions to safe
          levels</em></strong>; reinforced <strong>citizen economic security</strong> through “<strong>systemic safety nets</strong>”
          (such as &ldquo;basic income&rdquo; mechanisms), without which a <em>geophysically adequate</em>
          carbon tax would lead to vast social dislocation; ...and of the consequences
          ensuing from such combinations of &ldquo;flexible security&rdquo; policies: development
          and dissemination of <strong>&ldquo;clean energy&rdquo; technologies and methods</strong>,
          as these become micro-economically profitable <em>as rapidly as alternative ways
          become viable</em> :
          <strong>&ldquo;post-consumerist&rdquo; livelihoods and lifestyles</strong>;
          <strong>food security</strong> thanks to small-scale <strong>organic agriculture</strong> and
          <strong>agro-ecology</strong> generally, that <strong>remove CO2 from the atmosphere</strong>
          and <strong>strenghten resilience</strong> by <strong>recarbonizing the soil</strong>;
          <strong>mass empowerment of sustainable ways</strong> —and perhaps above all,
          <strong>circumventing Big Carbon</strong>'s stranglehold on the political process.</p>

          <p>The global carbon budget catalyzes all these goals:
          because energy runs through everything we do,
          it is <em>the cause that underpins a thousand causes</em>,
          the <em>factor</em> and <em>goal that triggers a thousand possibilities</em>.
          <em><strong>All will follow from a formal limit to cumulative carbon emissions.</strong></em>
          [ <a href="#collllapse-99" class="plus" role="button" data-toggle="collllapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collllapse-99">—</a> ]</p>

          <p>A <a href="http://onepointfivetosurvive.org/carbon-budget.php" target="_blank"><strong>SAFE CARBON BUDGET</strong></a> CAN BE DETERMINED BY
          AN <strong>INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC PANEL</strong>.</p>

          <p>Only this can ensure that
          a <strong>formal limit to manmade cumulative emissions</strong>
          is informed by the best available knowledge,
          to meet the survival imperative now before us.
          And this standard institutional tool, perfectly within reach,
          needed to secure an unobjectionable survival imperative,
          spells the beginning of the full transition
          to which History now summons Humanity.</p>

          <p>By targeting even minimal political action to <strong>the most consequential</strong>
          “<strong>climate policy</strong>,” climate-aware citizens will make it happen:
          as their clamor manifests the awareness needed to enact it,
          until political leadership emerges from our day's
          &ldquo;political polls followership&rdquo; to drive it into the global agenda.</p>
          <p>However long it takes. But the sooner the message attains
          the necessary critical mass, the sooner it will be catalyzed.
          The five years stipulated for revisions of emission commitments
          in the Paris Agreement now program five years of minimal mitigation.
          That’s a precious 35.9 gigatons of CO2 of the carbon budget that can be saved
          for every year that the beginning of serious emission reductions is advanced.</p>
          <p>But we already know one thing:
          history will remember the Paris Agreement as the Paris Suicide Pact.
          Unless it is corrected.</p>
