      <h1 class="title">A CITIZEN MANDATE TO EMPOWER RESPONSIBLE GOVERNANCE</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class="lead">Politicians are no more &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; today than they have always been.
          The problem is that even when they are aware of the <em>scale of the threat</em>,
          of the <em>speed of action</em> it summons, and concerned with
          <em>protecting society</em>, even the principled ones are impotent
          in the face of a historical challenge of unprecedented scope.</p>

          <p>For the climate threat represents no less than
          “<strong>a crisis of civilization that dares not speak its name</strong>,”
          as François Hollande once whispered.</p>

          <p>Governance, above all, is overwhelmed by 1) the <em>scale</em> of a transition that
          requires rapidly abandoning over 80% of the energy that fuels modern
          civilization, 2) the weight of <em>social inertia</em> due to public unawareness,
          3) the <em>interests vested</em> in the fossil fuels that survival requires abandoning.</p>

          <p><strong>1) AN ENVIRONMENTALLY EFFECTIVE AND POLITICALLY ATTAINABLE GOAL…</strong></p>

          <p>It should be obvious by now that the continuity of civilization presumes
          systemic change. We know that a historic “transition” is required.
          And that any transition presumes a clear understanding of,
          first, “where” we want to go, and then, “how” to get there.</p>

          <p>But this much is also clear:  we need to move <em>rapidly</em> to a radically
          <strong>carbon-constrained, carbon-equitable and carbon-neutral world</strong>,
          and this can be catalyzed less by techno-fixes than by appropriate
          —carbon-constrained, carbon-equitable and carbon-neutral—
          <em>institutional frameworks</em> at both the global and national levels.</p>

          <p>The first goal that the new institutional architecture
          needs to ensure is a <em>carbon-constrained global economy</em>:
          one that climate scientists can confidently expect to
          <strong>dispel undue risk of triggering </strong>“<strong>runaway global warming</strong>.”
          Any policy that achieves this goal must first specify it. </p>

          <p><span><em>By defining our goal more clearly, by making
          it seem more manageable and less remote,
          we can help all people to see it, to draw hope from it,
          and to move irresistibly towards it</em></span>. John F Kennedy</p>

          <p>We can give responsible but disoriented or handcuffed political
          representatives the popular mandate they need to overcome social
          and institutional inertia, and interests vested in the carbon economy,
          to beat their adversaries and begin securing a livable future:
          a “<strong>safe global carbon budget</strong>”.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">

          <p><strong>2) …AND A SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY CONSEQUENTIAL GOAL</strong></p>

          <p><em><strong>The most effective political action</strong></em> is that
          which aims at, and furthers, <em><strong>the most consequential</strong></em> goals.</p>

          <p>Many social causes and proposals now pursuing partial corrections of the
          present system can be shown to <em><strong>follow inexorably from its adoption</strong></em>:</p>
          <p>First and foremost, preservation of a livable future, <strong>protection of biodiversity</strong> and of <strong>the lives of the poor</strong>, who will be most impacted
          by global warming even though they are least responsible for it;
          by ensuring that civilization-threatening <strong>fossil fuels stay in the ground</strong>;
          the resulting <strong>divestment from carbon-dependant infrastructure</strong>,
          such as <strong>oil pipelines</strong> or environmentally and socially poisoning <strong>fracking</strong>; but also
          other investments in energy-intensive methods (lest they become stranded assets)
          thanks to a &ldquo;<strong>price on carbon</strong>&rdquo; that is <strong><em>high enough to reduce emissions to safe
          levels</em></strong>; reinforced <strong>citizen economic security</strong> through “<strong>systemic safety nets</strong>”
          (such as &ldquo;basic income&rdquo; mechanisms), without which a <em>geophysically adequate</em>
          carbon tax would lead to vast social dislocation; ...and of the consequences
          ensuing from such combinations of &ldquo;flexible security&rdquo; policies: development
          and dissemination of <strong>&ldquo;clean energy&rdquo; technologies and methods</strong>,
          as these become micro-economically profitable <em>as rapidly as alternative ways
          become viable</em> :
          <strong>&ldquo;post-consumerist&rdquo; livelihoods and lifestyles</strong>;
          <strong>food security</strong> thanks to small-scale <strong>organic agriculture</strong> and
          <strong>agro-ecology</strong> generally, that <strong>remove CO2 from the atmosphere</strong>
          and <strong>strenghten resilience</strong> by <strong>recarbonizing the soil</strong>;
          <strong>mass empowerment of sustainable ways</strong> —and perhaps above all,
          <strong>circumventing Big Carbon</strong>'s stranglehold on the political process.</p>

          <p>The global carbon budget catalyzes all these goals:
          because energy runs through everything we do,
          it is <em>the cause that underpins a thousand causes</em>,
          the <em>factor</em> and <em>goal that triggers a thousand possibilities</em>.
          <em><strong>All will follow from a formal limit to cumulative carbon emissions.</strong></em></p>
